1. I like the color choices to match with the org.
2. My site is more text, rather than image based.
2. 1. I think his has a better user experience because his infomration is clearly divided into appropriate sections.
2. 2. I think I have a more maintainable codebase because I only use one css file and kept all photos in 1 folder.
3. There are multiple css files but not in a seperate folder and photos not in a seperate folder. And has an empty css file
3. 1. remove the empty css file and put css files in a folder and images in another.
4. Remove commented out code, same font for every text
4. 1. Classes with only 1 use should be turned into ids
4. 2. There is a lot of duplication between the CSS files that could have been merged into one class
5. Have more to say on the home page, for example, why you'd want to join (If that's what the site is meant for)
